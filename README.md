# PacMan

This is a program that finds a route for PacMan, given a map, from the input starting junction to the given end junction using a search algorithm.
This project contains three solutions to the same problem that implements **Depth-First Search**, **Depth Limited Depth-First Search**, and **Depth-First Iterative Deepening**
to search for a route. This program was implemented as assignment work for the University College of Dublin's COMP3008L course.
